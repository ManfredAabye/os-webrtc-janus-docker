# os-webrtc-janus-docker

Voice for the the [OpenSimulator] family of virtual world simulators requires
a [WebRTC] service to mix and distribute the spacially modified voice streams.

This project is for building and running a [Docker] image to run as a service
with a region simulator and a grid server to supply voice for the space and
groups.
